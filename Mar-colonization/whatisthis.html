<h1> ABOUT <img src="four.gif" width="240" height="160" class="d-inline-block align-top" alt="" loading="lazy"></h1>
<p id="para">Tic-tac-toe (American English),Noughts and Crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.</p>
<h1>History <img src="one.gif" width="266" height="200" class="d-inline-block align-top" alt="" loading="lazy"></h1>
<p id="para">"Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt,where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BCE."</p>

<p id="para">"An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time) and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing.The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. Another closely related ancient game is three men's morris which is also played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to finish, and Picaria, a game of the Puebloans."</p>

<p id="para">"The different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to "noughts and crosses" (nought being an alternative word for zero), the British name, appeared in 1858, in an issue of Notes and Queries.The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884, but referred to "a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored". "Tic-tac-toe" may also derive from "tick-tack", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The US renaming of "noughts and crosses" as "tic-tac-toe" occurred in the 20th century."</p>

<p id="para">"In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), developed by British computer scientist Sandy Douglas for the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge, became one of the first known video games.The computer player could play perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent."</p>
<p id="para">"In 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements. The Tinkertoy computer, made out of (almost) only Tinkertoys, is able to play tic-tac-toe perfectly.It is currently on display at the Museum of Science, Boston."</p>

<h4 >RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE</h4>
      			<ol id="para"><li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
      				<li>You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</li>
      				<li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>
      				<li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>
      			</ol>
<h4>HOW CAN I WIN AT TIC-TAC-TOE? </h4>
      			<p id="para">To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.</p>
      			<p id="para">Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three Os in a row.</p>
      			<p id="para">After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choices—which ones might let you make three Xs in a row.</p>
      			<p id="para">You also have to watch where the computer puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the computer gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.</p>
      			<p id="para">If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you'll tie.</p>
